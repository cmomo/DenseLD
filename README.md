# DenseLD_Data
Sample data used to demonstrate the application of DenseLD fine-mapping approach. 


# Implementation
"SampleAnalysis/DenseLD_demo.html" shows an example of performing fine-mapping using DenseLD with a simulated sample data.

The analysis consists of three may steps.

### 1. Detection of Dense LD
Note: an example conducted in MATLAB using function "denseLD.m" can be found in "SampleAnalysis/demo_mat.html".
### 2. Convert dense LD block structure to graph object
### 3. Perform causal variant selection by incorporting the graph object of LD matrix into fused-LASSO

### Plots generated during analysis are uploaded in folder "png". 
"heatmap_BPorder" and "heatmap_DENSEorder" are two heatmaps generated by MATLAB. These plots show the same LD matrix of the sample data in different orders (i.e., the natural physical positions and the order rearranged by DenseLD).

"Manhattan plot by BPorder-1" and "Manhattan plot by DENSEorder-1" are the two Manhattan plots generated by R. These plots show the p-values of the same sample data in different orders (i.e., the natural physical positions and the order rearranged by DenseLD).

"Trend plot of beta by lambda-1" shows the trend of beta shrinkage using DenseLD fine-mapping approach (i.e., fused-LASSO incorporating dense LD block structure).

Sine one of the SNPs produced extreme values when fitting by the regression model, we generated a plot, "Trend plot of beta by lambda (remove extreme beta)-1", to remove the extreme SNPs in order to better display the trend of the other SNPs.
